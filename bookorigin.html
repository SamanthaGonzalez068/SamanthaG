        <p>As of currently I am sitting in the cafe near my house. A few belongings accompany me: phone, wallet, keychains, and the book that emerged from thin air. Appearing out of nowhere a week ago on the 12th. Just a gust of wind, being gently placed on my vanity table. No one else was in the room. Then, a knock, sounding sharper than it should were one to knock on this chamber’s door. Took a second, even less, maybe; turning around letters were written in the mirror.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p>The writing was as follows: 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> “You may not know my name; thou I am aware of your existence. Aren’t you a peculiar one? You can communicate with me; it would be impossible to understand if you weren’t one of them. Being quite honest dear, even those without a soul become quite bored of existing. After ‘living’ for eons things get quite monotonous. Have this present, it is situated over your vanity, that pretty little book you keep side eyeing. Open it, it’s yours, contains a few secrets of the trade that you should be aware of…”
            Time stopped the same moment I was done reading, everything froze, how could it know? Impossible, couldn’t be… My feet moved before my thoughts, unaware of what was happening. Leading towards the vanity, taking the hardcover book in hands. Balance tipping to the left, standing facing the fireplace as purposely the book fell off my hands into the flames. If the book was not here neither should the thing that put this upon me. A few seconds passed, enough for today, maybe downing that bottle of whiskey before bed was not the best choice. Hopefully it was just a hallucination of the inebriated mind. 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> Chest palpitations, eyes couldn’t open, heart was pounding, the drum of it resounding in my skull. Gaining vision; everything was blurry for a few beats. Looking down, the damned book was there again, laid upon my chest.  Enough, whoever or whatever was trying to communicate with me was just toying with my sanity. Looking in the mirror, the message was gone... and so was the mirror. Shattering most likely while asleep, probably wasn’t glued correctly to the frame, that’s the only reason one could come up with in this state. The room became pitch black. Candles began to burn, a scent of decay emerging. A silhouette formed at the foot of the bed. Dark, relatively short, with pale eyes who shone amongst the flames. 
            Speaking; “Did not know someone as yourself would be such a bad gift receiver. Would have come personally the first time if there had been a clue. Burning the book, are you insane?! Do you even know the power it holds you scatterbrained girl?!”
            I sat there, blinking, still holding the book that started this entire shit show. Now, being insulted by this 5’4 woman with grayish purple skin and white hair.             
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> “First of all, who are you? Secondly, how dare you? Third, what the fuck are you?!”
            Now she was the one blinking, wearing a confused look. “Ok drama diva, first the name’s Gothier, although just call me Gothy, Gothier makes me feel older. Secondly, I’m death, and lastly what do you mean how dare I?! You should be crawling and saying thank you at my feet insolent woman. But anyways, aside from that... I have a job for you; one you cannot decline.”
            “... And what would that job be?”
            “Quite simply, there's way too many souls in limbo right now and I am having trouble managing them. With the book a necromancer can revive the dead... well if you're strong enough that is.             
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> Many have died trying to achieve such a feat.” Contemplating, I looked at the being. Honest expression gracing their features. “Fine, let's do it. I have a feeling I do not have the choice to decline.” White, all around, a flash, not even a second later we were somewhere else that was not my dormitory.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> “Mind if I ask where we are?” Limbo is all that was said. Structures and islands held by chains, a world of black and white. Screams filling eardrums, pure agony at sight...it was glorious. Although the problem was obvious, truly the place was brimming with entities. The lands oversaturated to the top.
            “I blame modern society for this, the low birth rates combined with the number of wars and plagues currently happening do not help either”, Gothier said …
            “What do we have to do?”, she answered: “Quite simply, you follow whatever the book gave you to do and bring someone back to life, that way I can use you for the task in the future”.            
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p>I opened a few pages, there was the writing, the symbols, smacking me right in the face of this reality being faced. Gothier sent me back to the world of the living. Tasked with collecting bodies, organs, and some weird stones. Thankfully having contacts in the morgue helped with most of the dirty work, and gems are not that hard to find when the town across has mines full of them. 
            A few days later everything was acquired, ready for the ritual, So I went to the cemetery, it had the odd specification in the nook, so I was not going to judge. Once arrived, venturing deeper into the tombs, darkness surrounded, getting absorbed into the ground.            
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> “Since when were you welcomed here dear?” The void spoke. Gothier mentioned something about it. It came to collect, sadly my hands were empty. All the bodies collected were gone. Nowhere in sight, nowhere to touch. Interestingly enough, the human realm and this one did not connect. it was supposed to but had no idea how. Now in front of it I absorbed my being.  Feeling the desperation, fear, it reveled in it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> “You have come this far and returned home empty handed” The void spoke, just a voice in the vast ocean of black. Limbs were severed, blood flowing as it cascaded around, organs were there too, a liver, lungs, a heart... Macro peered down, nobody at sight, well, not where it should have been at least. Awareness filled her, the body parts floating were hers, now just a head unable to speak, only blink and fight with the voices inside. “Wondering how it turned out like this or how to fix it? The choice belongs to you, abandon your humanity, become a god, or just wait to perish as the human you were born”

        </p>
      </div>
  

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> A pause... a bulb shone, “I am Macro Ullathorne, daughter of Francis Ullathorne and Mirage Von Crow, descendant of those who communicate with the undead. I am no god nor human, I am a being of death” 
            Red, that was all I could see. Limbs came back to their place, ligaments starched and connected, blood flowing back. My soul got out, a reflection in crimson, body, mind, and soul, all finally untied yet separated in one place. It was time to go back. Everything needed for the summoning was done and acquired. Last thing left to do was come back to the land of the living and defy the gods.                     
</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="centered-text">
        <p>  “Ų̵̋n̷̝͝i̶̢͐t̶̰́e̵̋͜d̸̺́ ̵̭̈́ä̴̯́s̷̪̽ ̵̘̇o̷̤͛n̵̯̋ĕ̴͍,̶̢̑ ̴̼͗h̷̕ͅe̸̬͘a̵̪̒r̷͔̚ ̵̧̃m̷͍̈́y̵̞̅ ̵͚̾c̶͓͗ä̶́ͅl̸̾ͅl̷͕̿,̸̘̐ ̶̳̈́s̸͚̽u̵͊͜m̶̞͌m̴̟̈́ó̸̱n̵͍͝ ̴̟̾t̴̼͠ḣ̵͉o̶̬͊s̷͉͋ẽ̴̘ ̸̫̃w̵̠̾h̶͕̄o̵̟̅ ̷̣̕a̶̛̠r̴̺̚ė̶͎ ̵̣̃n̴̦͋o̴͙̊ť̴̗ ̸͎̈ȃ̶̱l̸̯̀i̵̻̎ṿ̵̉ē̷̺,̵͔̈́ ̷̬̆a̸̤̓ǹ̴͍d̶̫̃ ̸̖̾r̴̘͝i̸͕͑ḓ̴̆ ̸̛̲u̶͚̒s̵̻̊ ̶͙͘ö̵̧f̵̧͊ ̷̺͒ḟ̸ͅa̸͌ͅṫ̸̞e̷͈̚.̶̯̌”

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> Vision clearing, physically finally at the cemetery, now it was time for the dirty work. Gothier was waiting when I came back to my senses. Could not keep quiet for a second before speaking; “So... What did it tell you? What’s the tea?” A sigh, responding; “No clue, made to collect random stuff, fight myself, getting dismembered; which I do not recommend, is trippy and feels weird. Overall discovering I am practically a freaky superhuman being that can revive the dead is just the cherry on top. Isn’t life fun?!”
            “Ok trauma dumping much.” She scoffed. 
            “Drama aside, let's revive this dead person, shall we?”
            Everything was ready, the blood circle was made, surrounded by bodies, ravens circling, then the words from the book just flowed, an ancient language impossible to understand.
            A figure emerged from the circle, a woman, skin dark as obsidian with eyes to match, beautiful face with slanted eyes and full lips, more interestingly so, hands missing skin, bones red as the blood flowing through our body. A magnificent sight. Confused, she looked in my direction. Gothier disappearing in thin air.

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> She was scared, panicked, but got calmer as time went by. Explanations were given. Her name was Farrah Miller. Apparently, she died in 2009. A headshot, no clue as to why, a random shot at her direction. That is all she recalled. Days passed by, now with her living with me, it was hard getting used to her presence but now it is comforting. Still getting accustomed to modern society but all in due course. Now a necromancer able to defy the laws of logic and the supernatural, it was nice to know how much power was held within my soul. Hidden but ready at my beck and call. Able to go back between Earth, Limbo, and the Void. Although with extra responsibility now due to a specific goddess of death. Would I have done things differently, not really, I am quite selfish to do that.

      <div class="centered-text">
        <p> Back to March 19 of 2011, sitting at the cafe, I forgot to mention my current company. Farrah is sitting across from me, reading a new magazine from this morning. Drinking a latte so sweet only she could stomach. Still wearing gloves to hide those bony red hands. Would not want to make a scandal this early in the morning, understandably so. We still have a long day ahead of us. On another thought, I will keep the book for a while, a bad omen, but so am I as well. Quite the upgrade being able to speak with the dead to reviving people who had died years ago. Don't you think, dear reader? </p>
